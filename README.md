# IAT
Image Analysis Toolset contribute section

## Image Analysis Toolset GUI

Here you can contribute to localization of IAT in your language.

Each folder is named with the last chars that indicate the associated language according [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

You can push your contributes in this Git repository, or attach the translated files in a mail to
![Mail](https://github.com/SMH17/IAT/blob/master/maa1l.png)

You can find the strings that must be translated to compile also the non-translated languages in one of the folders of the completed languages (e.g. values-en).
